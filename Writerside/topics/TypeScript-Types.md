# TypeScript Types
TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, enabling developers to catch errors early and improve code 
maintainability.

Types define the shape of data, ensuring that values behave as expected throughout a program.

## Why Use Types in TypeScript?
- Prevents runtime errors by catching issues at compile time.
- Improves code readability and maintainability.
- Enables better tooling support, including IntelliSense and auto-completions.
