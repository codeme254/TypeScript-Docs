# Dynamic vs. Static Typing

All major programming languages that we work with are either **dynamically typed** or **statically typed**.

**Dynamically typed** means that the type of variables can change at runtime.

In dynamically typed languages, data types are determined at runtime, meaning you donâ€™t need to explicitly 
declare variable types.

Examples of dynamically typed languages include: JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python e.t.c.

Example in JavaScript:
```JavaScript
let x = 5; // x is a number
x = "Hello"; // x is now a string (no error)
console.log(x); // Output: Hello
```

In the example above, the variable `x` starts as a number but is later assigned a string without any issue.

**Statically typed** means that the type of variables cannot change once declared.

In **statically typed** languages, data types are checked at compile time, meaning you must explicitly declare or 
infer variable types.

Examples of statically typed languages include: TypeScript, Java, C++, C#, Swift e.t.c.

Example in TypeScript:
```TypeScript
let x: number = 5; // x is explicitly declared as a number
x = "Hello"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```
