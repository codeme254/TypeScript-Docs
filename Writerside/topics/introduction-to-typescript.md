# Introduction to TypeScript
TypeScript is a statically typed language that was designed and is currently being maintained by Microsoft.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and not a replacement of JavaScript, all the features available in JavaScript 
exist in TypeScript, and it extends these features and adds more functionality.

Using TypeScript allows us to check errors at **compile time**.

The workflow is that we write code in TypeScript and then compile it to JavaScript, during compile time, we 
catch type errors.
