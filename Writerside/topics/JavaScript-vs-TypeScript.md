# JavaScript vs TypeScript

Some key differences between JavaScript and TypeScript are:

**Typing**  
JavaScript is dynamically typed while TypeScript is statically typed with optional dynamic typing.


**Error Detection**  
In JavaScript, errors are detected at runtime, while in TypeScript, errors are detected at compile time.


**Tooling**  
JavaScript has basic support for code completion and debugging, while TypeScript has enhanced 
IDE support with autocompletion, type-checking, and better refactoring tools.


**Compilation**  
JavaScript runs directly in the browser without the need for compilation while TypeScript needs to be converted into
JavaScript before execution in the browser.
